# CCSU_V1
V1 view for Primo Back Office for CCSU, not inheriting from Central Package for Consortium-wide Primo (CSCU)
Note the improvement in custom.js for the emergency banner and yet preserving a hide function that was included in Central Package by MH as part of the showing search all consortium libraries section at the bottom of search engine results pages. My prior custom.js for the Primo banner had lost several lines of code, which created a bug in appearance of the scrolling sidebar upon browser resize and scrolling down and back up again.
